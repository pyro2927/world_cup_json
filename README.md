== ABOUT

This is a simple backend for a scraper that grabs current world cup results and outputs them as JSON.

== SETUP

* Clone the repo

* ```rake setup:generate_teams``` to generate the teams

* Run the following two tasks as cron jobs, to pull in data with whatever time frame you want (every 5 minutes for example):
```rake fifa:get_group_results``` (This pulls in the standings of the group stages)
```rake fifa:get_all_matches``` (This pulls in all matches and updates any that need updating)

==TODO

* Static landing page
* Add CSS class to determine knocked out teams

==ENDPOINTS

    [url]/teams/
for a list of teams with group ID and FIFA code

    [url]/group_results/
for current results (wins, losses, draws, goals for, goals against, knock out status)

    [url]/matches/
for all matches (Example JSON object at the bottom of this README)

==OTHER ENDPOINTS

    [url]/matches/today/
    [url]/matches/tomorrow/

(what it says on the tin)

You can also retrieve the matches for any team if you know their FIFA code by passing it in as a param.

    Example: [url]/matches/country?fifa_code=USA

==Optional Parameters

You can append `?order=desc` to any query to reverse sort the matches by `match_number`.
